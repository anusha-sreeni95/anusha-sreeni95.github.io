A Computer Science graduate student at the University of Southern California with a work experience of two years at Endurance International Group(Directi) and Morgan Stanley as a software engineer. I am currently the Senator of Computer Science of Viterbi Graduate Student Association at USC.

Worked on projects dealing with image processing and machine learning. Particularly interested in the field of data mining. Active participant in hackathons and proud winner of the Wonder Coders hackathon organized by Walmart Labs. Also a member of ACM community at USC.

An eloquent presenter, recognized leader and public speaker, I'm the recipient of the best paper presentation award at the 9th International Conference on Bioscience, Biochemistry and Bioinformatics held at the National University of Singapore.

Recognised as the Subject Matter Expert of HashiCorp Vault, I have given Expert Speak sessions on the same to ensure all projects at EIG adhere to security related best practices. My motto is to be committed to the task that I'm assigned to, which eventually transforms into complete end to end ownership of the entire project - communicating with stake holders, design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance. My skill was recognized at Endurance International Group (Directi) and I was bestowed the Einstein Award for Delivering Perfection.

To add colour to my professional life, I also follow my passion of dancing. I'm a graded Doordarshan (Indian National Television) Bharathanatyam dancer and aptly stand by the pseudo name 'The Coding Dancer'.
